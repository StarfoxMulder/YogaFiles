* **Instructions**

  * Using the connection and song data you put together earlier into the class, we are going to print playlists to the Git Bash console based upon the genre or artist.

  * First create code that prints all songs within your database to Git Bash.

  * Now create code that prints songs of a specific genre/artist to the Git Bash console.

    * If you don't have many songs in your database at this point in time, take this moment to add some more to it. Try to give yourself a variety of songs to work with.

    * HINT: Remember that you can call specific data using SQL commands we went over last class. If you are having trouble, make sure to look into SQL commands once more.

  * BONUS: See if you can create more stylized tables within the Git Bash console

    * This will require utilizing some JavaScript to pull off smoothly, but will be a huge boon to your tackling the homework if you can figure out how to accomplish this task now.

  *BONUS: See if you can make a MySQL query which, instead of taking in a complete string, can contain variables which switch up the search parameters.

    * There are a couple different ways to accomplish this task, but the most common one can be found within the documentation for the MySQL NPM package.
