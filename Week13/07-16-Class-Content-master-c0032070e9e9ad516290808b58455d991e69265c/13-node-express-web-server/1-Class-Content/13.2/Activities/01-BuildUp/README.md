	* `server1.js` (`01-BuildUp1`)

* **Instructions:**
	
	* Work with those around you to confirm your `server1.js` file working. This means figuring out: what dependencies to install, how to run the file, and how to view the resulting website in your browesr. This step requires you to make ZERO changes to the code file. At this point, you are just getting the file you are given to run.

	* Then once you have a working server instance, begin to examine the file. Try to explain to yourself and those around you what the significance of `/:characters` and `req.params.characters` is.

	* Create a test case to check your hypothesis. 

### Part 3

* **File:**

	* `server3.js` (`01-BuildUp1`)

* **Instructions:**
