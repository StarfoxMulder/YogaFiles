* **Instructions**:
    * Using either `logic.js` (easier) or `logic-option2.js` (harder) as a starting point, create the CodersBay app using a Firebase database to store data on the backend.

    * Your application should be able to run on multiple browser winows simultaneously and register click events on each screen correctly.
