* **Instructions**

    * Create two variables. Both variables should be numbers representing the cost of an item for sale (e.g. 4.99)

    * Define a function that takes in two parameters — the two variables you've created will be the arguments — and returns their sum.

    * Define another function that takes in one parameter — a number — and returns that value increased by 10%.

    * Pass the variables you created to the first function and then pass the resulting sum through the second function. Console log the result.

        * If you use 4.99 and 11.49 as the initial values, then you should get 17.96 as a result.
