Answer: What is Sequelize?
	A promise-based ORM for Node.js and io.js

Answer: What advantages does it offer?
	- Testing (having separate databases for dev.Env and one for production)
	- Open Source (greater functionality and uptime than something you build yourself)
	- MUCH easier to use than mySQL Workbench for creating and manipulating data within a SQL database!!!!

Answer: How do I install it? How do I incorporate it into my app?
	- npm install --save sequelize
	- var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
		  host: 'localhost',
		  dialect: 'mysql'|'mariadb'|'sqlite'|'postgres'|'mssql',

		  pool: {
		    max: 5,
		    min: 0,
		    idle: 10000
		  },

		  // SQLite only
		  storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite'
		});

		// Or you can simply use a connection uri
		var sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname');
